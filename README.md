<h2>Welcome to Donde!</h2>

By: Dan Fyfe

**Setup**
- Complete the setup in the [Donde Back End directory](https://github.com/danfyfe/donde_back_end)
- In your terminal, while inside the Donde Front End directory, run 'npm install', and 'npm start'

**Basic Idea and Usage**
- This app was made for household item management. If you live in household with other people who are always moving your things, this app will help you keep track of where everything is and notify you when your items have been moved, where they were moved to, and who moved them.
- After signing up, the user is brought to the profile page which displays the user's households and all messages associated with those households. The user can create a household by clicking 'add household' and completing the form, or use the search icon at the top of the page to search for an already created household. If your housemates have created a household, they will need to give you the password before you can join it.
- Once the user has created or joined a household, they can create a space(a closet, room, cabinet, etc), a container inside of that space(box, bag, etc) and an item inside of that container.
- Once the household, spaces, containers, and items have been set, the user can navigate through the hierarchy to the item card, or use the same search bar mentioned above to search for the item they would like to move. The results of the item search will only display items that the user has access to through the households they belong to. Clicking on the item card will bring the user to the item's page.
- From the item's page, the user can move the item by clicking the 'move item' button and filling in the appropriate information. Once the form is submitted, a message will automatically be posted to the Household's page and a text message sent to the item owner(s) phone numbers, if set up.
- Note: For ease of demonstration, you can login with the username: 'John', and search for and join household: 'Apt'. All seeded passwords are a very secure '123' :)
